    "faq": {
      "howToAddSpeech": {
        "question": "How do I add a new speech?",
        "answer": "Tap the + button on your dashboard, paste your speech text, give it a title, and optionally set a goal date. The AI will automatically break it into learnable segments."
      },
      "whatIsBeat": {
        "question": "What is a 'beat'?",
        "answer": "A beat is a small section of your speech (usually 2-4 sentences) that the app helps you memorize one at a time. Once you master a beat, you'll combine it with others."
      },
      "howManySpeeches": {
        "question": "How many speeches can I have?",
        "answer": "Free users can have 1 active speech per month. Premium users have unlimited speeches."
      },
      "howPracticeWorks": {
        "question": "How does practice mode work?",
        "answer": "Practice mode shows your speech text with some words visible as cues. Speak your speech aloud - the app tracks your words in real-time and highlights your progress. Words you know well gradually fade out."
      },
      "whyWordsHidden": {
        "question": "Why are some words hidden?",
        "answer": "The app uses adaptive learning to hide words you've mastered. This challenges your memory and helps you truly memorize rather than just read. Tap hidden words if you need a hint."
      },
      "micNotWorking": {
        "question": "My microphone isn't working",
        "answer": "Make sure you've granted microphone permissions in your browser/device settings. Try using Chrome or Safari for best compatibility. If issues persist, try refreshing the page."
      },
      "whatIsSpacedRepetition": {
        "question": "What is spaced repetition?",
        "answer": "Spaced repetition is a scientifically-proven learning technique. Instead of cramming, you review material at optimal intervals - just as you're about to forget. This builds stronger, longer-lasting memories."
      },
      "whyWait": {
        "question": "Why do I have to wait to practice?",
        "answer": "Waiting is part of the learning process! Your brain consolidates memories during rest. Practicing too early can actually interfere with this process. Trust the AI scheduling for best results."
      },
      "canPracticeEarly": {
        "question": "Can I practice early if I want?",
        "answer": "Premium users can bypass the waiting period with the 'Practice Anyway' button. However, for optimal memorization, we recommend following the scheduled times."
      },
      "whatIsPresentation": {
        "question": "What is presentation mode?",
        "answer": "Presentation mode is a full run-through of your speech without any visible script. It simulates the real experience. After you finish, you get detailed AI feedback on accuracy, missed words, and areas to improve."
      },
      "whenUsePresentation": {
        "question": "When should I use presentation mode?",
        "answer": "Use it when you feel confident with your speech and want to test yourself. It's great for final preparation before the real thing!"
      },
      "howStreaksWork": {
        "question": "How do streaks work?",
        "answer": "Practice at least once per day to maintain your streak. The streak counter shows how many consecutive days you've practiced. It resets if you miss a day."
      },
      "streakReset": {
        "question": "What happens if my streak resets?",
        "answer": "Don't worry! Your progress isn't lost, just the streak counter. Keep practicing and build it back up. Consistency is more important than any single number."
      },
      "howDeleteAccount": {
        "question": "How do I delete my account?",
        "answer": "Go to Settings → scroll to the bottom → tap 'Delete Account'. This permanently removes all your data including speeches, progress, and account information."
      },
      "changeLanguage": {
        "question": "How do I change the app language?",
        "answer": "Go to Settings → Language → select your preferred language. The app supports English, Swedish, Spanish, French, German, Italian, and Portuguese."
      }
    },
